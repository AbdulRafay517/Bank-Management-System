### Project Description: Bank Management System

#### Overview
The **Bank Management System** is a Java-based application designed to manage and streamline various banking operations. The system leverages a MySQL database to store and manage user account information, including details like account numbers, personal details, and account balances. The primary functionalities include loading data from the database, saving new data, deleting accounts, and searching for specific account details.

#### Key Features

1. **Account Management**
   - **Load Data**: Fetches all account details from the MySQL database and stores them in an in-memory list for quick access.
   - **Save Data**: Inserts new account details into the database, ensuring that all records are updated with the latest information.
   - **Delete Account**: Removes an account from the system based on the account number.
   - **Search Account**: Provides functionality to search for an account by account number, returning the account details if found.

2. **Data Storage**
   - **MySQL Database**: The system uses a MySQL database to persist account information. The connection details (URL, username, password) are configured within the application.

3. **User Interface**
   - This project currently focuses on the backend logic and data management. The user interface can be implemented separately using various Java-based GUI frameworks or as a web application.

#### Technical Details

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Libraries/Technologies**:
  - `java.sql` package for database connectivity and SQL operations
  - `ArrayList` for in-memory storage of account records

#### Getting Started

1. **Setup Database**: Ensure MySQL is installed and set up on your machine. Create a database named `bank_management` and the necessary tables.

2. **Configuration**: Modify the database connection details (`url`, `user`, `password`) in the `BankRecord` class to match your local setup.

3. **Run the Application**: Compile and run the Java application. The system will connect to the database and perform the desired operations.
